## Introduction

Recognizing gestures and actions is a critical aspect of human-computer interaction, allowing computers to interpret human body language and movements. This masterclass provides a comprehensive guide to detecting body points and recognizing gestures and actions using state-of-the-art techniques.

## Detecting Body Points

In this section, we explore methods for detecting key body points in images and videos. Accurate detection of these points is essential for further gesture and action recognition tasks.

## Gesture Recognition

Next, we delve into gesture recognition, covering various techniques and models used to identify specific gestures from detected body points. This includes both the theoretical background and practical implementation steps.

## Action Recognition

We also cover action recognition, focusing on how to identify complex actions involving multiple body points and movements over time. This section includes examples and code to help you implement action recognition systems.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to install the necessary Python packages. You can do this using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, and then you can run the cells sequentially to detect body points and recognize gestures and actions.

```bash
jupyter notebook "Computer Vision Masterclass - Recognition of gestures and actions.ipynb"
```

## Examples

The notebook includes several examples demonstrating the detection of body points and recognition of gestures and actions. These examples cover:

- Detecting key body points in images and videos
- Recognizing specific gestures from detected body points
- Identifying complex actions involving multiple movements

Each example includes detailed explanations and code to help you understand how to apply these techniques to your own projects.
